# Contributing to Velox

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Velox! This guide will help you get started.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24 or later
- golangci-lint (for linting)

### Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/syssam/velox.git
cd velox
go test ./...
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run tests with race detection
go test -race ./...

# Run a specific package's tests
go test ./compiler/gen/sql/...
```

### Running Linter

```bash
golangci-lint run
```

### Formatting Code

```bash
gofmt -s -w .
goimports -w .
```

## Code Style

This project follows the [Google Go Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/go/) and [Uber Go Style Guide](https://github.com/uber-go/guide/blob/master/style.md). See `CLAUDE.md` for detailed project-specific conventions.

Key points:
- Use `slog` for structured logging (not `log`)
- Use `any` instead of `interface{}`
- Use modern octal syntax (`0o644`)
- Generated files must include `// Code generated by velox. DO NOT EDIT.` header
- Follow interface segregation: implement `MinimalDialect` for basic support, `DialectGenerator` for full support

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Write tests for any new functionality.
3. Ensure all tests pass: `go test ./...`
4. Ensure the linter passes: `golangci-lint run`
5. Keep commits focused and write clear commit messages.
6. Open a pull request with a description of what changed and why.

## Reporting Issues

When reporting a bug, please include:
- Go version (`go version`)
